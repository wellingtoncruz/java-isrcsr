A simulator for radiative process in solar flares. Include the
Microbunching Instability teory observed in particles acelerators,
calculating both Coherent Synchrotron Radiation and Incoherent
Synchrotron Radiation. Based in Fortran algorithms by Reuven Ramaty
(1969) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1969ApJ...158..753R and Synclab
written in pure Java, abstracted for receive input parameters and
